                    <p>This post expands on the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/xlingual">ACL 2019 tutorial on Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning</a>.</p><p>The tutorial was organised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/">Ivan Vulić</a>, <a href="https://anderssoegaard.github.io/">Anders Søgaard</a>, and me. In this post, I highlight key insights and takeaways and provide additional context and updates based on recent work. In particular, I cover <a href="index.html#unsupervised-deep-models">unsupervised deep multilingual models</a> such as multilingual BERT. You can see the structure of this post below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/10/unsupervised_multilingual_overview.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>The slides of the tutorial are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1miPu0hkBFSRTAxP-Psg0xXOvAbVSJPhQXehMQdUI88I/edit?usp=sharing">available online</a>.</p><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1><p>Cross-lingual representation learning can be seen as an instance of transfer learning, similar to domain adaptation. The domains in this case are different languages. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/10/cross_lingual_learning_taxonomy.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Cross-lingual learning in the transfer learning taxonomy (<a href="https://ruder.io/thesis/neural_transfer_learning_for_nlp.pdf#page=64">Ruder, 2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>Methods from domain adaptation have also been applied to cross-lingual transfer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.0716">Prettenhofer &amp; Stein, 2011</a>, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f08f/269b715c31bfa02dc4df31f5561fd74222f0.pdf">Wan et al., 2011</a>). For a clearer distinction between domain adaptation and cross-lingual learning, have a look at <a href="https://ruder.io/thesis/neural_transfer_learning_for_nlp.pdf#page=63">this section</a>.</p><p>Viewing cross-lingual learning as a form of transfer learning can help us understand why it might be useful and when it might fail: </p><ol><li>Transfer learning is useful whenever the scenarios between which we transfer share some underlying structure. In a similar vein, languages share commonalities on many levels—from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword">loanwords</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognate">cognates</a> on the lexical level, to the <a href="https://universaldependencies.org/">structure of sentences</a> on the syntactic level, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_primes">meaning of words</a> on the semantic level. Learning about the structure of one language may therefore help us do better when learning a second language.</li><li>Transfer learning struggles when the source and target settings are too different. Similarly, it is harder to transfer between languages that are dissimilar (e.g. that have different typological features in the <a href="https://wals.info/languoid">World Atlas of Language Structures</a>).</li></ol><p>Similar to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fIhGikFPnb7G5kr58OvYC3GN4io7MznnM0aAgadvJfc/edit#slide=id.g5888218f39_46_122">broader transfer learning landscape</a>, much of the work on cross-lingual learning over the last years has focused on learning representations of words. While there have been approaches that learn sentence-level representations, only recently are we witnessing the emergence of <a href="index.html#unsupervised-deep-models">deep multilingual models</a>. Have a look at <a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11640/26511">this survey</a> for an overview of the history of cross-lingual models. For more on transfer learning, check out <a href="https://ruder.io/state-of-transfer-learning-in-nlp/">this recent post</a>. Cross-lingual learning might be useful—but why should we care about applying NLP to other languages in the first place?</p><h2 id="the-digital-language-divide">The Digital Language Divide</h2><p>The language you speak shapes your experience of the world. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a> and is contested. On the other hand, it is factual that the language you speak shapes your experience of the world <em>online</em>. What language you speak determines your access to information, education, and even human connections. In other words, even though we think of the Internet as being open to anyone, there is a <a href="http://labs.theguardian.com/digital-language-divide/">digital language divide</a> between dominant languages (mostly from the western world) and others.</p><p>As NLP technologies are becoming more commonplace, this divide extends to the technological level: At best, this means that non-English language speakers do not benefit from the latest features of digital assistants; at worst, algorithms are biased against or discriminate against speakers of non-English languages—we can see <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/business/alexa-does-not-understand-your-accent/">occurrences</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/voice-is-the-next-big-platform-unless-you-have-an-accent/">of this</a> <a href="https://qz.com/1141122/google-translates-gender-bias-pairs-he-with-hardworking-and-she-with-lazy-and-other-examples/">already</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a44674">today</a>. To ensure that non-English language speakers are not left behind and at the same time to offset the existing imbalance, we need to apply our models to non-English languages.</p><h2 id="the-nlp-resource-hierarchy">The NLP Resource Hierarchy</h2><p>In current machine learning, the amount of available training data is the main factor that influences an algorithm's performance. Data that is useful for current NLP models can range from unlabelled data in the form of documents online or articles on Wikipedia, labelled data in the form of large curated datasets, or parallel corpora used in machine translation.</p><p>We can roughly differentiate between languages with many and languages with few data resources in a hierarchy, which can be seen below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/10/nlp_resource_hierarchy.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>A conceptual view of the NLP resource hierarchy</figcaption></figure><p>This approximately corresponds with a language's presence online. Note that many languages cannot be assigned clearly to a single level of the hierarchy. Some languages with few speakers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragonese_language">Aragonese</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waray_language">Waray-Waray</a> have a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias_by_speakers_per_article">disproportionally</a> <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">large Wikipedia</a>, while for others such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_language">Latvian</a> <a href="https://www.statmt.org/europarl/">parallel data</a> is available due to their status as an official language. On the other hand, many languages with tens of millions of speakers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhosa_language">Xhosa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language">Zulu</a> have barely more than <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias">1,000 Wikipedia articles</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the existence of such a hierarchy highlights why unsupervised cross-lingual representation learning is promising: for most of the world's languages, no labelled data is available and creating labelled data is expensive as native speakers are under-represented online. In order to train models for such languages, we need to make use of unlabelled data and transfer learning from high-resource languages.</p><h2 id="cross-lingual-representations">Cross-lingual Representations</h2><p>Whereas in the past it was necessary to learn language-specific models for every language and preprocessing and features needed to be applied to every language in isolation, cross-lingual representation learning enables us to apply the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fIhGikFPnb7G5kr58OvYC3GN4io7MznnM0aAgadvJfc/edit#slide=id.g56add75db5_0_104">transfer learning formula</a> of pretraining and adaptation <em>across languages</em>. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/10/transfer_learning_formula.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The transfer learning formula (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fIhGikFPnb7G5kr58OvYC3GN4io7MznnM0aAgadvJfc/edit#slide=id.g56add75db5_0_104">NAACL 2019 Transfer learning tutorial</a>)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In this context, we will talk about a (high-resource) source language \(L_1\) where unlabelled data and labelled data for a particular task are available, and a (low-resource) target language \(L_2\)  where only unlabelled data is available.

<li><strong>Pretraining</strong>: Learn <em>cross-lingual</em> representations that are shared across languages. This is what the rest of this post is about.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation</strong>: Adapt the model to the labelled data of the desired task in \(L_1\) by learning task-specific parameters on top of the cross-lingual representations. The cross-lingual parameters are often kept fixed (this is the same as <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fIhGikFPnb7G5kr58OvYC3GN4io7MznnM0aAgadvJfc/edit#slide=id.g5888218f39_59_11">feature extraction</a>).

Depending on the task, there are other ways of transferring information across languages such as by domain adaptation (as seen above), annotation projection (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5694.pdf">Padó &amp; Lapata, 2009</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02483">Ni et al., 2017</a>; <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1172/">Nicolai &amp; Yarowsky, 2019</a>), distant supervision (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1061/">Plank &amp; Agić, 2018</a>) or machine translation (MT; <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1133/">Zhou et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08998">Eger et al., 2018</a>).</p><h2 id="why-not-machine-translation">Why not Machine Translation?</h2><p>In light of the recent success of <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/10/exploring-massively-multilingual.html">massively multilingual</a> and unsupervised machine translation (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1549/">Lample et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1019/">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>), an obvious question is why we would not just use MT to translate the training data in our source language to the target language and train a model on the translated data—or translate the test set and apply our source model directly to it, which often works better in practice. If an MT system is available, this can be a strong baseline (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1269/">Conneau et al., 2018</a>) and unsupervised MT in particular can be useful for low-resource languages (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1549/">Lample et al., 2018</a>).</p><p>However, an MT system for the desired language pair may not be easily available and can be expensive to train. In addition, models trained on machine-translated data often underperform <a href="index.html#deep-unsupervised-models">state-of-the-art deep multilingual models</a>. MT struggles with distant language pairs and domain mismatches (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1632/">Guzmán et al., 2019</a>). It is also not a fit for all tasks; the performance of translation-based models for question answering tasks depends heavily on the translation quality of named entities (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1227/">Liu et al., 2019</a>). For sequence labelling tasks, MT requires projecting annotations across languages, itself a difficult problem (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1344/">Akbik &amp; Vollgraf, 2018</a>).</p><p>In general, however, MT and the methods described in this post are not at odds but complementary. Cross-lingual word representations are used to initialise unsupervised MT (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01313">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>) and cross-lingual representations have been shown to improve neural MT performance (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07291">Lample &amp; Conneau, 2019</a>). Techniques from MT such as word alignment have also inspired much work in cross-lingual representation learning (<a href="https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11640/26511">Ruder et al., 2019</a>). Finally, a multilingual model benefits from being fine-tuned on translations of the labelled data in multiple languages (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116">Conneau et al., 2019</a>).</p><h1 id="main-framework">Main Framework</h1><p>We now discuss how to learn unsupervised representations, starting at the word level.

They only require monolingual word embeddings trained in each language and then simply learn a linear projection that maps between the embedding spaces. The general framework can be seen in the Figure below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/10/projection_framework.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>A general framework for projection-based cross-lingual word embeddings (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1070/">Glavaš et al., 2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Given monolingual embedding spaces \(\mathbf{X}_{L_1} = \{\mathbf{x}^i_{L_1} \}^{|V_{L_1}|}_{i=1} \) and \(\mathbf{X}_{L_2} = \{\mathbf{x}^j_{L_2} \}^{|V_{L_2}|}_{j=1} \) in two languages where \(\mathbf{x}\) is a word embedding and \(|V|\) is the size of the vocabulary, we perform the following steps (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1070/">Glavaš et al., 2019</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Construct a seed translation dictionary</strong>. The dictionary \(D = \{w^i_{L_1}, w^j_{L_2} \}^K\) contains \(K\) pairs of words and their translations.</li>
<li><strong>Create word-aligned monolingual subspaces</strong>. We create subspaces \(\mathbf{X}_S = \{\mathbf{x}^i_{L_1}\}^K_{i=1} \) and \(\mathbf{X}_T = \{\mathbf{x}^j_{L_2}\}^K_{j=1} \) where \(\mathbf{X}_S \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times d}\) and \(\mathbf{X}_T \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times d}\) where \(d\) is the dimensionality of the word embeddings. We do this simply by looking up the vectors of the words and their translations in the monolingual embedding spaces, \( \{w^i_{L_1} \} \) from \(\mathbf{X}_{L_1}\) and \( \{w^j_{L_2} \} \) from \(\mathbf{X}_{L_2}\) respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Learn a mapping between the subspaces to a common space</strong>. Specifically, we project the matrices \(\mathbf{X}_S\) and \(\mathbf{X}_T\) into a common space \(\mathbf{X}_{CL}\). In the general setting, we learn two projection matrices \(\mathbf{W}_{L_1} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d} \) and \(\mathbf{W}_{L_2} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) to project \(\mathbf{X}_{L_1}\) and \(\mathbf{X}_{L_2}\) respectively to the shared space.</li>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We often treat one of the monolingual spaces \(\mathbf{X}_{L_1}\) (typically the English space) as the cross-lingual space \(\mathbf{X}_{CL}\) and only learn a mapping \(\mathbf{W}_{L_2}\) from \(\mathbf{X}_{L_2}\) to this space. The standard approach for learning this mapping is to minimise the Euclidean distance between the representations of words \( \mathbf{X}_T \) and their projected translations \( \mathbf{X}_S\mathbf{W} \) in the dictionary \(D\) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4168">Mikolov et al., 2013</a>):</p>

Intuitively, this ensures that when \(\mathbf{W}_{L_2}\) vectors are projected to the \(\mathbf{X}_{CL}\) space that the structure of the monolingual embedding space is preserved. If \(\mathbf{W}_{L_2}\) is orthogonal, then the optimisation problem is known as the so-called Procrustes problem (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02289451">Schönemann, 1966</a>), which has a closed form solution:</p>

If the writing systems of two languages share the same alphabet, then there will be many words that are spelled the same in both languages, many of them named entities such as "New York" and "Barack Obama". A list of pairs of such identically spelled words can be used as a weakly supervised seed dictionary (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1072/">Søgaard et al., 2018</a>). Even if languages do not share alphabets, many languages still use Arabic numerals, which can be used as a seed dictionary (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1042/">Artetxe et al., 2017</a>).</p><p>Such a weakly supervised seed dictionary is available for most language pairs and works surprisingly well, often outperforming purely unsupervised approaches. Intuitively, despite being noisy, a dictionary consisting of identically spelled words provides a sufficient number of anchor points for learning an initial mapping.</p><p>Still, it would be useful to have a seed dictionary that is independent of a language's writing system. Rather than requiring that translations should be similar (e.g. spelled the same), we can go one step further and require that translations should be similar to other words across languages <em>in the same way</em> (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1073/">Artetxe et al. 2018</a>). In other words, the similarity distributions of translations within each language should be similar.</p><p>Specifically, if we calculate the cosine similarity of one word with all other words in the same language, sort the values, and normalise, we obtain the following distributions for "two", "due" and "cane":</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/10/intralingual_similarity_distributions.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Intralingual similarity distributions of three words (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1073/">Artetxe et al., 2018</a>).</figcaption></figure><p>The intralingual similarity distributions of translations such as "two" and "due" should be more similar compared to other words such as "cane". Based on this insight, we can use the nearest neighbours of our similarity distributions across languages as the initial dictionary.

Joint training has been applied not only to Transformers but also to LSTM-based methods where initialisation with CLWEs has been found useful (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1392/">Mulcaire et al., 2019</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/11/translation_language_modelling.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The supervised cross-lingual language modelling objective of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07291">Lample and Conneau (2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mapping-based-approaches">Mapping-based approaches</h2><p>The mapping-based approaches that we discussed previously have also been applied to the contextual representations of deep bilingual models. The main assumption behind these methods is that contextual representations—similar to their non-contextual counterparts—can also be aligned via a linear transformation. As can be seen in the Figure below, contextual representations cluster and have similar distributions across languages.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/11/contextual_aligned_landscape.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>PCA visualisation of contextual embeddings of the English word "bear" and its two possible Spanish translations, "tener" and "oso" in an aligned multilingual space (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1162/">Schuster et al., 2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>For contextual representations, the mapping can be done either on the token level or on the type level. On the token level, contextual representations of tokens in both languages can be aligned using word alignment information in parallel data (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1391/">Aldarmaki &amp; Diab, 2019</a>). On the type level, an aggregate representation of a word's contextual representations such as its mean can be used as its type embeddings (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1162/">Schuster et al., 2019</a>). Type embeddings across languages can then be aligned using the same mapping-based approaches as before. <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/K19-1004/">Liu et al. (2019)</a> perform further analyses and find that type-level alignment performs best. Mapping-based methods have also recently been applied to BERT-based representations (<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1l-C0NtwS">Anonymous et al., 2019</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01464">Wu et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Rather than learning a mapping between two existing pretrained models in \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), we can apply a model that was pretrained in a high-resource language \(L_1\) to a low-resource language \(L_2\) much more easily by simply learning token-level embeddings in \(L_2\) while keeping the model body fixed (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11856">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkle6T4YvB">Anonymous et al., 2019</a>). The full process can be seen below. This alignment to a monolingual model may avoid the non-isomorphism of fixed monolingual vector spaces and the resulting model is competitive with jointly trained models.</p>

(2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><h1 id="future-directions">Future Directions</h1><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>A standard task for evaluating CLWEs is bilingual lexicon induction (BLI), which evaluates the quality of the cross-lingual embedding space by determining whether words are nearest neighbours of their translations in a test dictionary. Recently, several researchers have identified issues with the standard MUSE dictionaries (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04087">Conneau et al., 2018</a>) for this task, which only represent frequent words and are not morphologically diverse (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1090/">Czarnowska et al., 2019</a>; <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1328/">Kementchedjhieva et al., 2019</a>). BLI performance on words with lower frequency ranks drops off drastically as can be seen below.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/11/dictionary_frequency_ranks_landscape.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>BLI performance vs frequency rank of words in MUSE and new dictionaries (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02855">Czarnowska et al., 2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>We are ultimately interested in applying our methods to downstream tasks in low-resource languages. While BLI correlates well with certain downstream tasks for mapping-based approaches (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1070/">Glavaš et al., 2019</a>), the correlation is weaker for methods that are not based on an orthogonal transformation. Downstream evaluation is thus important to accurately gauge the performance of novel methods in the future.</p><p>However, even existing cross-lingual downstream tasks have their problems. Cross-lingual document classification, a classic task for the evaluation of cross-lingual representations (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C12-1089/">Klementiev et al., 2012</a>), mostly requires superficial keyword-matching and CLWEs outperform deep representations (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11856">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>). A more recent multilingual benchmark, XNLI (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1269/">Conneau et al., 2018</a>) may be plagued by similar artefacts as the MultiNLI dataset from which it has been derived (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-2017/">Gururangan et al., 2018</a>).</p><p>On the whole, we need more challenging benchmarks for evaluating multilingual models. Question answering might be a good candidate as it is a common probe for language understanding and has been shown to be harder to exploit. Recently, several cross-lingual question answering datasets have been proposed, including XQuAD (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11856">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>), which extends SQuAD 1.1. to ten other languages, the open-domain XQA (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1227/">Liu et al., 2019</a>), and MLQA (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07475">Lewis et al., 2019</a>).</p><h2 id="understanding-representations">Understanding representations</h2><p>Benchmarks are also important for better understanding the representations that our models learn. Along these lines, it is still unclear what makes monolingual embedding spaces non-isomorphic. Even embedding spaces between similar languages are not strictly isomorphic as can be seen below. Similar issues might affect the spaces of deep contextual representations. Identifying the cause of this phenomenon may help us gain a better understanding of our learning algorithms and the biases they encode in their representations. It may also shed light on the semantic similarities and differences between languages.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/11/nn_graphs_freq_words_landscape.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Nearest neighbour graphs of 10 most frequent nouns in English and their German translations (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1072">Søgaard et al., 2018</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>There have been several studies analysing what CLWEs learn but it is still mostly unclear what representations learned by unsupervised deep multilingual models capture. As token-level alignment to a deep monolingual model achieves competitive results (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11856">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>), deep multilingual models may still mostly learn lexical alignment. If this is the case, we need better methods that incentivise learning deep multilingual representations. Parallel data improves performance in practice (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07291">Lample &amp; Conneau, 2019</a>), but for low-resource languages we would like to use as little supervision as possible.</p><p>Deep representations from an English BERT model can be transferred to another language without any modification (besides learning new token embeddings; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11856">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>). Consequently, it should be interesting to analyse what cross-lingual information monolingual models capture. In order to gain new insights, however, we need better benchmarks and evaluation protocols for the analysis of cross-lingual knowledge.</p><h2 id="practical-considerations">Practical considerations</h2><p>In the end, we'd like to learn cross-lingual representations in order to apply them to downstream tasks in low-resource languages. In light of this, we should not forget practical concerns of such low-resource scenarios. While zero-shot transfer is a focus of current methods, <a href="http://nlp.fast.ai/classification/2019/09/10/multifit.html">zero-shot transfer is not free</a>. It requires access to training data from the same task and distribution in a high-resource language. We should thus continue investing in approaches that can be trained with few samples in a target language and that combine the best of both the monolingual and cross-lingual worlds, for instance via cross-lingual bootstrapping that can be seen below (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1572/">Eisenschlos et al., 2019</a>).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://ruder.io/content/images/2019/11/multifit_bootstrapping_landscape.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Steps of a cross-lingual bootstrapping method for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1572/">Eisenschlos et al., 2019</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, recent deep multilingual models are large and expensive to train. Training smaller multilingual models, for instance via distillation (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1374/">Tsai et al., 2019</a>), will be key for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.</p><p>Recent wide-coverage parallel corpora such as JW-300 (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1310/">Agić &amp; Vulić, 2019</a>) and WikiMatrix (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05791">Schwenk et al., 2019</a>) enable the training of massively multilingual or supervised systems for many new low-resource languages where parallel data was previously not available. However, these resources still do not cover languages where only few unlabelled data is available. In order to apply our methods to tasks in such languages, we need to develop approaches that can learn representations from a limited number of samples. Resources that provide limited data (mostly dictionaries) for a large number of languages are the <a href="https://asjp.clld.org">ASJP database</a>, <a href="https://panlex.org/">PanLex</a>, and <a href="https://babelnet.org/">BabelNet</a>.</p><p>Finally, while CLWEs underperform deep multilingual models on more challenging benchmarks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11856">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>), they are still preferred for easier tasks such as document classification due to their efficiency and ease of use. In addition, they serve as a useful initialisation to kick-start the training of deep models (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1392/">Mulcaire et al., 2019</a>; <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bkle6T4YvB">Anonymous et al., 2019</a>) and of unsupervised NMT models (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01313">Artetxe et al., 2019</a>). Consequently, they may be a useful foundation for the development of more resource and parameter-efficient deep multilingual models.</p><h2 id="citation">Citation</h2><p>If you found this post helpful, consider citing <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-4007">the tutorial</a> as:</p><pre><code>@inproceedings{ruder2019unsupervised,
